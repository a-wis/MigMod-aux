# MigMod-aux

## MigMod package supporting materials

This repository contains the code and data for running the MigMod model in case the installation of [`MigMod`](https://a-wis.github.io/MigMod/) fails. This requires having [`rstan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) package installed with all required dependencies.
